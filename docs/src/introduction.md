# [ `fxtools` ]

## Introduction

`fxtools` is a collection of `fastx` related utilities I've
needed to write for one reason or another to perform
various functions. 
The tool is a collection of sequence processing utilities
written in rust and focusing generally on sequence
transformations.

`fastx` is a term that means *either* FASTA or FASTQ.
The utilities in this tool generally do not care which
format the sequences are in, and will handle them
appropriately.

All subcommands within the tool are documented here, but
should be usable and understandable from their help menus.
